# About

![Version 1.230417](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version_1.230417-ad5f00?style=for-the-badge)

Albedo is a theme for EmulationStation. It's a fork of [Elementerial](https://github.com/mluizvitor/es-theme-elementerial), another ES theme built by me.
It has flat surfaces, plays with transparency and sharp edges.

> This theme supports custom backgrounds. Read [CUSTOMBG.md](CUSTOMBG.md) for more details.
> 
> I made an web app to load, crop and save images named as the designated system.
> It's not powerful as Photoshop or GIMP, but help collect a lot of images and download them in one go.
> 
> Access [Albedo Wallpaper Cropper](https://albedo-wallpaper-cropper.vercel.app).
> 
>  If you're concerned about privacy, this web app will never collect or send any information anywhere. The images loaded are saved locally on the browser database. As an web app, it can be used offline after the first load.

# About Auto Collection Logos

Elementerial now show logo for some auto/custom collections.

## What are collections?
Collections are a way to arrange your games.
You can create editable or dynamic collections.
Editable collections are those you manually add games,
while Dynamic collections are those you can set filters or search texts. 

To create a new collection on EmulationStarion and enable them to be displayed on main screen/carousel:

On EmulationStation → Start → Game Collection Settings
1. Group unthemed custom collections (disabled)
2. Create new editable/dynamic collection
   1. Insert the name of the collection 
   2. See the list below for collection names that have a logo

## Currently supported franchises

There is a couple of logos for the following franchises:
- `Final Fantasy`
- `Mario`
- `Metroid`
- `Persona`
  - I like to create Persona collection as a dynamic collection and use the text `persona, megami tensei` as **Find Games** content, so the collection gathers all games with *Persona* and *Megami Tensei* in its titles (which includes Shin Megami Tensei as well).
- `Pokemon`
- 
Miscellaneous Collections:
- `Grouvee Playing`

The names listed are case sensitive and with white spaces (like in `Final Fantasy`). If you use any variation like `MariO` or `final-fantasy` your collection will not display the logo.
